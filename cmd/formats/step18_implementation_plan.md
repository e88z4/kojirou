# Kojirou Multi-Format Implementation Plan - Step 18

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for Step 18: Final Integration of the Kojirou Kobo support project. The goal is to connect all components developed in previous steps, add comprehensive error handling, and ensure proper logging for all format-specific operations.

## Tasks

### 1. Update `run` Function
- [x] Add early format validation
- [x] Add detailed logging of selected formats
- [ ] Implement structured logging for each step in the process
- [ ] Add summary output when processing is complete

### 2. Enhance Format Selection Handling
- [x] Parse formats early in the run function
- [x] Validate format selection before any processing
- [ ] Add clear error messages for invalid formats
- [ ] Add logging for format-specific parameters (RTL, autocrop, etc.)

### 3. Connect Components
- [x] Update `handleVolume` to use enhanced progress reporting
- [x] Ensure shared resources are properly generated once
- [ ] Connect format generators with proper error handling
- [ ] Implement format selection flags completely

### 4. Error Handling
- [x] Track format-specific errors separately
- [x] Continue processing other formats on error
- [x] Collect and report all errors at the end
- [ ] Add detailed error information for debugging
- [ ] Handle specific error types differently (network, filesystem, etc.)

### 5. Logging
- [x] Add format-specific progress indicators
- [ ] Add consistent logging throughout generation
- [ ] Log success/failure for each format
- [ ] Include timing information for operations
- [ ] Add debug logging for troubleshooting

### 6. Testing
- [x] Create end-to-end tests for format generation
- [x] Test error handling scenarios
- [x] Test format selection and validation
- [ ] Test with actual manga data
- [ ] Add performance tests for multi-format generation
- [ ] Test cross-format dependencies (EPUB->KEPUB)

## Implementation Notes

### Progress Reporting
We've enhanced the progress reporting system to handle multiple formats with format-specific indicators, messages, and tracking. Each format has its own progress bar, and the main progress bar tracks overall volume processing.

### Format Processing Flow
1. Validate selected formats early
2. Check if all formats for a volume exist before processing
3. Load shared resources once (pages, metadata)
4. Generate shared EPUB if needed for EPUB/KEPUB formats
5. Process each format with its own progress reporting
6. Track success/failure for each format
7. Report final status with all format results

### Error Handling Strategy
- Track format-specific errors separately without failing the entire process
- Continue with other formats if one fails
- Collect all errors and report them in a consolidated manner
- Provide specific error information for each format

## Next Steps
After completing Step 18, we'll move on to testing and quality assurance, focusing on comprehensive testing of all formats, error scenarios, and edge cases.
